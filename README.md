Epic Game
===
Info
---
This is a simple OpenGL project for [JDL.ro](http://JDL.ro)
In the future it will probably be an awesome puzzle game, but for now you're in a room with some 3D models :)

The game is now in **Alpha** stage.

See CHANGELOG for info about the current version.
How to play

###Windows
Download this repository, open `windows/opengl_project.sln` and build. You need `glut32`, `glew32` and `bass` libraries.
###Linux
Download this repository, navigate with your terminal to it (using cd) and enter this command:
```

Note: You must have `glew` installed. Install it using:

Enjoy.
Note

Feel free to use/improve `lobjder` and `motion` libraries. Both were written by me.
